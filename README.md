# Projects

## Hard deadline: 24 hours before the exam

A project amounts to 40% of your final grade.
A project is to be done by a single student, no teamwork allowed. 
The maximum number of points for a project is 100, with concrete subtasks having different values. 

Each project should be followed by a written report in which the following topics are discussed: 
1
* What the task was.
* The architecture of your solution. 
* Why certain architecture dessisions were done.
* Why certain libraries were chosen. 
* Investigation of the performance.
